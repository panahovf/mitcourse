# Finger exercise 1

# Assume 3 variables are already defined for you: a, b, and c. 
# Create a variable called total that adds a and b then multiplies the result by c. 
# Include a last line in your code to print the value: print(total)


# Solution
a = 3
b = 4
c = 5

total = (a+b)*c

print(total)
